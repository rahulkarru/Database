In the last session we have created a datasets and pushed our work to github.As of Today,I had the dataset which was merged then as we know for the reidentification attacks we need to merge the data 
by some kind of identity among them and then we need to get the remaining info by the data where we found the identification so,i need to divide the data into two chunks where there will be two 
different csv files so for the geographical representation we then updated dataset naming using_geographical_data.csv and for healthcare we named using_healthcare_data.
